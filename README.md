# Hummingbird

There will eventually be three folders here: ./sims for simulations (Matlab/Simulink mostly), ./myRIO for control software written for the NI MyRIO (might be Labview VIs, C/C++, or a hideous mixture of the two if that's possible), and ./teensy for control software written for a Teensy-3.1-based flight computer. For now, there's just a README. Ho hum.
